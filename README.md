# Hands-On SQL Exercises

Welcome to the SQL Challenge Repository! This repository contains 9 of the most challenging and unique SQL problems, specially selected to enhance your SQL skills. Each challenge folder includes:

* A SQL script file solving the challenge.
* A detailed README file explaining the step-by-step solution.

These challenges are for educational purposes, and I encourage you to dive in, experiment, and even submit your own solutions! Whether you have alternative approaches, suggestions for improvement, or feedback, feel free to open a pull request.

## Requirements
All challenges are solved in MS SQL Server. To run the queries, you will need to have one of the following installed:

* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* Azure Data Studio

Both are free to download and set up. Instructions for setting up SQL Server are available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16).
